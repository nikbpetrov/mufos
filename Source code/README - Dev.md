# MUltiple tests corrections and FOrmatted tables Software (MUFOS)

## For developers
Information about the software development, its architecture, quality control and reuse potential (i.e. how it can be built upon), please see the this preprint (link coming soon).

For additional information about underlying procedures and calculations, see the MUFOS Help Guide and Documentation document.

Note: when packaging for MacOs, there is a known issue with tkinter (see [here](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/3820) ).
The solution used is copying the [msgcat-1.6.1.tm](https://github.com/nikbpetrov/mufos/blob/master/Source%20code/msgcat-1.6.1.tm) into one of the tk folders - see [here](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/3820#issuecomment-515673901).

In case of any problems, questions or feedback, please contact the leading developer at [nikbpetrov@gmail.com](mailto:nikbpetrov@gmail.com).
